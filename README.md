# Exercise 2: Triatomic energy plotter
Program to plot energies of specific triatomic molecules as a function of their geometry and find their equillibrium geometry, and find vibration frequencies of their symmetric stretching and bending modes for Part II Chemistry Programming Practical Exercise 2.

## Available data input modes
* `local`    Input data from local files stored within the `\outfiles` subdirectory within the program folder. Individual `.out` files should be stored within a subfolder named `[molecule]outfiles` where \[molecule\] is the name of the molecule, e.g. `H2O`.
